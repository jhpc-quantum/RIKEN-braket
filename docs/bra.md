# bra

## Introduction

*bra* is an interpreter of "quantum assembler" codes to perform simulation of quantum computers.

## Requirements

*bra* requires a C++14 compliant compiler and the [Boost C++ library](https://www.boost.org/).
Any [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/) libaries are also required if you would like to use *bra* in massively parallel supercomputers.

## How to build *bra*

### Using Makefile

It is not difficult to build *bra* if you have [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) in your environment.
Usually *bra* can be built just by using `make`:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/RIKEN-braket/bra
$ make <command>
$ ls bin/
bra
$
```

You can specify `<command>` in the form of either `[nompi-]<build>[-<fp>]` or `nompi[-<fp>]`, where `[]` means optional.
For example, the realease version of *bra* in which single-precision floating-point numbers are used is built by the comand `make release-float`.

* `<build>` is to specify if the release version or the debug version is built. Possible values are "release" and "debug".
* `<fp>` is to specify which tpye of floating-point numbers is used in the simulator *bra* to represent real and imaginary parts of complex numbers. Possible values are "float" and "long", and `float` and `long double` is used, respectively. If `<fp>` is unspecified (e.g., `make release`), `double` is used by default.
* `nompi-*` represents *bra* without using an MPI library is built. MPI version is built by default if `nompi-` is unspecified (e.g., `make release`).

Note that, if no `<command>` is specified (just `make`), the release version with linking an MPI library and with using `double` as a type of floating-point numbers are built, which means `make release` is the default command.

You can build *bra* on (the login servers of) the supercomputer Fugaku in the same way, without editing Makefile.
Note that the Fujitsu C++ compiler `FCCpx` is used in this case.

### Editing Makefile

You would like to edit Makefile to build *bra* if, for example,
* you want to use a compiler other than GCC,
* you use the Fujitsu compiler, but you use other than the supercomputer Fugaku,
* you don't have the Boost library on your environment, so you download its tarball or any kinds of archive file from the [official web page](https://www.boost.org/users/download/), or
* you would like to add other compile/link options to build *bra*.

#### Other compiler

The compiler to build *bra* is specified via `CXX`.
The easiest way to change to your compiler is to replace `$(CXX)` to the command you want to use.

https://github.com/jhpc-quantum/RIKEN-braket/blob/ec5460b24455de307949ad1289752af94415ef29/bra/Makefile#L174-L180

#### Fujitsu compiler, but you use other than the supercomputer Fugaku

The Makefile uses the command `uname -n` to know the hostname of the login server.
After that, it uses the `findstring` function to understand if the login server is on the supercomputer Fugaku or not.

https://github.com/jhpc-quantum/RIKEN-braket/blob/ec5460b24455de307949ad1289752af94415ef29/bra/Makefile#L44-L50

You can build by using the Makefile if you change the conditional directives in the Makefile appropriately.

#### Adding include path of Boost library

The directories of libraries are specified at the line starts with `library_dirs`.

https://github.com/jhpc-quantum/RIKEN-braket/blob/ec5460b24455de307949ad1289752af94415ef29/bra/Makefile#L18-L20

Add the directory of the Boost library you expanded, `/path/to/boost`, to the line.
Don't specify the *include path* itself `/path/to/boost/include` there.

#### Adding other options

Edit the lines start with `common_flags` or `cxx_flags` to add other options.

https://github.com/jhpc-quantum/RIKEN-braket/blob/ec5460b24455de307949ad1289752af94415ef29/bra/Makefile#L171-L172

If you would like to add options only to the linker, edit the line starts with `LDFLAGS`.

https://github.com/jhpc-quantum/RIKEN-braket/blob/ec5460b24455de307949ad1289752af94415ef29/bra/Makefile#L34-L36

## Usage

### Nompi version

*bra* can be used in the following way:

```bash
$ ./bin/bra --file <path> --threads <threads> --seed <seed>
```

* `--file <path>`: specifies the path of "quantum assembler" file. If this option is omitted, "quantum assembler" code is read from the standard input. Therefore `./bin/bra < <path>` and `/path/to/script_generating_my_excellent_quantum_circuit | ./bin/bra` are OK.
* `--threads <threads>`: specifies the number of threads. The default value is `1` if this option is omitted.
* `--seed <seed>`: specifies the initial seed of the random number generator. You can omit this option, too.

### MPI version

There are additional options other than ones of the nompi version of *bra*.

```bash
$ mpiexec -n <processes> ./bin/bra --file <path> --threads <threads> --seed <seed> --mode <mode> --unit-qubits <unit-qubits> --unit-processes <unit-processes> --page-qubits <page-qubits>
```

## Quantum assembler

So-called "quantum assembler" code is required to use *bra*.
*bra* supports all instructions presented in Appendix of [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.11.005), but more gates are also supported.

The instruction set supported by *bra* is as follows[^1].

[^1]: There are some multi-qubit gates in this instruction set. The number of qubits (sum of target and control qubits) which can be specified is determined by the macro `BRA_MAX_NUM_OPERATED_QUBITS`, which can be set when building *bra*. Its default value is 10.

* `I i`: identity gate operated on qubit $i$, $I (a_0 \ket{0} + a_1 \ket{1}) = a_0 \ket{0} + a_1 \ket{1}$. This gate performs MPI communication of a gate with one qubit, e.g., `X i`.
* `IC c`: identity gate operated on control qubit $c$, $I_\mathrm{C} (a_0 \ket{0} + a_1 \ket{1}) = a_0 \ket{0} + a_1 \ket{1}$. This gate performs MPI communication of a gate with one control qubit, e.g., `Z c`.
* `CCCIII c1 c2 c3 t1 t2 t3` or `C3I3 c1 c2 c3 t1 t2 t3`: the controlled identity gate. Qubits $c_1$, ..., $c_3$ are control qubits and $t_1$, ..., $t_3$ are target qubits. If you use two control qubits and two target qubits, use `CCII c1 c2 t1 t2` or `C2I2 c1 c2 t1 t2` instead. This gate performs MPI comunication of a gate with control and target qubits, e.g., `CCCZZZ c1 c2 c3 t1 t2 t3`.
